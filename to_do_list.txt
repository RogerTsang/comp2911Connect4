NEED TO CHANGE:
---------------
- Fix UI/animation issues, especially when clicking fast
- Need losing sound rather than just winning sound for when playing against AI
- Fix player 2 not greying out properly once we change player 1
- Change AI to work automatically rather than with buttons
- Fix Show/Hide stats button messing up UI
- Saving profile stats
- Guest profile should not have a show/hide options button (since it doesn't have stats)
- Make undo only work a certain number of times, and show that amount on the button itself
- Make profile panels look better? (Lots of white space at this point + undo button isn't positioned very well)
