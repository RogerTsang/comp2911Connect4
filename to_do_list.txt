NEED TO CHANGE:
---------------
- System and UI need to be in seperate thread (no need to do this right now)
- System/UI interaction needs to be bi-directional (OR create gameSystem.getAITurn() public method)
- Decide on whether we want it to be scaleable, and if so, alter the layout manager to GridBagLayout
- Remove console outputs and alter other outputs
- Change undo so we only have a limited amount, and not at all in H-H (maybe the amount should depend on difficulty level?)
- Write toString method for Player (just to clean code up)
- Change make AI move to return int, it shouldn't call move() in GameSystem- should only interact with Board
- General code clean-up

THINGS TO ADD:
--------------
- Make win/lose information more noticeable
- Score shows how many rounds each player has won
- "Thinking period" for AI
- Add information on side of board about players. Along with this, have a picture of a piece next to their info that is grayed out when it isn't their turn
- Menus and options panel
- Saving profiles to disc to keep track of stats, and ability to change between profiles on startup and in options panel
- Scaleable UI
- Sound when piece drops down column, as well as animation if someone can figure that out
- More AI difficuly levels/better AI in general

BONUS THINGS TO ADD AFTER ABOVE ARE FINISHED:
---------------------------------------------
- Change code to be general, e.g. so we can have any n x n size board, with k number of pieces in a row to win
- Fancy up graphics e.g. draw a proper board and pieces in a graphics program
- Unlockables
