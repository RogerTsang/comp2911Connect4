NEED TO CHANGE:
---------------
- Fix UI/animation issues, especially when clicking fast
- Need losing sound rather than just winning sound for when playing against AI
- Fix Show/Hide stats button messing up UI
- Guest profile should not have a show/hide options button (since it doesn't have stats)
- Maybe make profile panels look better? (Lots of white space at this point + undo button isn't positioned very well)
