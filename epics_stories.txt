UI (Game screen) :
- Create JFrame (window)
- Divide window into 42 panels, each representing a piece holder
- Add toggle for each panel, to be able to show either nothing, a red piece, or a yellow piece
- Add mouse click event logic so that clicking on a column sends information to the game back-end for processing
- Write updateBoard(Board b) method so that the game back-end can send the UI a new board for displaying

UI (Menu) :
- Add two buttons two JFrame, one for exit, one for new game

Back-end (Engine) :
- Write methods for taking information sent by UI (e.g. mouse click on column) and processing that into commands to change the board
- In the method that processed mouse clicks (turns) send the new board to the UI method updateBoard(Board b) for displaying
- Write private method to check if game has been won or is a stalemate (AFTER the board has already been updated)

Back-end (Board) :
- Add 2D array of pieces to represent board
- Add methods for changing board (addPiece(int columnNumber), clearBoard() etc.)
